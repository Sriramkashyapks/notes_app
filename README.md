# Notes Application

The project involves developing a note-taking application called Notes App. The primary focus of the application is to provide users with a simple and efficient tool for capturing and organizing their thoughts and tasks. The application follows a material design aesthetic, providing a clean and intuitive user interface.

One of the core features of Notes is automatic saving, ensuring that users never lose their notes. The application continuously saves the notes in the background, eliminating the need for manual saving and minimizing the risk of data loss.

Notes App offers a customizable user interface, allowing users to personalize the app with their preferred colors and themes. This feature enhances the user experience by enabling them to create a visually pleasing environment while using the application.

It shows the list of notes with title, date & time of creation and overview/discription of notes (i.e first 2 lines of the notes) in the home page of the application.

The application includes a robust search functionality that enables users to quickly find their older notes. This feature makes it effortless to retrieve and reference previously recorded information, saving time and enhancing productivity.

Furthermore, Notes App allows users to share their notes. This feature facilitates collaboration and information sharing among individuals or teams, making it easy to distribute and collaborate on projects, tasks, and ideas.
